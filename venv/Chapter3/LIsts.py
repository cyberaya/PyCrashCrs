# A list is a collection of items in a particular order. You can make a list that
# includes the letters of the alphabet, the digits from 0â€“9, or the names of
# all the people in your family.

# In Python, square brackets ( [] ) indicate a list, and individual elements
# in the list are separated by commas.
